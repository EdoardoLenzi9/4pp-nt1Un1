Rules for First Sets

If X is a terminal then First(X) is just X!
If there is a Production X ? e then add e to first(X)
If there is a Production X ? Y1Y2..Yk then add first(Y1Y2..Yk) to first(X)
First(Y1Y2..Yk) is either
First(Y1) (if First(Y1) doesn't contain e)
OR (if First(Y1) does contain e) then First (Y1Y2..Yk) is everything in First(Y1) <except for e > as well as everything in First(Y2..Yk)
If First(Y1) First(Y2)..First(Yk) all contain e then add e to First(Y1Y2..Yk) as well.
Rules for Follow Sets

First put $ (the end of input marker) in Follow(S) (S is the start symbol)
If there is a production A ? aBb, (where a can be a whole string) then everything in FIRST(b) except for e is placed in FOLLOW(B).
If there is a production A ? aB, then everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B)
If there is a production A ? aBb, where FIRST(b) contains e, then everything in FOLLOW(A) is in FOLLOW(B)
